# W1D1 Breakout Activity Instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ Personal Finance Calculator - Quick Start Guide

### For Students

#### Option 1: Run the Demo (Recommended for beginners)
```bash
python demo.py
```
This will show you the calculator with sample data first, then ask if you want to try interactive mode.

#### Option 2: Run the Full Interactive Calculator
```bash
python personal_finance_calculator.py
```
Enter your own financial data and get personalized analysis.

#### Option 3: Run the Test Suite
```bash
python test_calculator.py
```
See how the code validation and testing works.

### Common Student Questions & Answers

**Q: Why use Decimal instead of float?**
A: Financial calculations need precision. Float can have rounding errors like `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004`

**Q: What are type hints for?**
A: They help with code clarity and enable better IDE support and error checking.

**Q: Why so much error handling?**
A: Real applications must handle invalid input gracefully. Users will enter unexpected data!

**Q: What's the benefit of classes vs just functions?**
A: Classes group related data and behavior together, making code more organized and reusable.

### Troubleshooting

#### If students get import errors
Make sure they're running Python from the correct directory where the files are located.

#### If calculations seem wrong
Walk through the logic step by step using the demo data as an example.

#### If students are overwhelmed
Start with just running the demo, then explore one function at a time.
