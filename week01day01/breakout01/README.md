``` real problem into code following Python best practices. Remember: every complex system started as simple pieces.

## 📝 Breakout Activity Instructions

**Room Assignment:** 3-4 learners per room  
**TA Instructions:** One TA per 2 rooms, rotate every 8 minutes

**Problem:** Calculate monthly budget and savings potential

### Breakout Room Timeline

- **Minutes 0-5:** Discuss problem decomposition as a group
- **Minutes 5-15:** Implement functions individually  
- **Minutes 15-20:** Share solutions and debug together

### TA Guidance Points

- ✅ Encourage thinking before coding

- ✅ Celebrate different approaches
- ✅ Note common struggles for debrief

## 🚀 Application Overview

This Personal Finance Calculator demonstrates Python best practices through **complete implementation of the W1D1 starter code functions** plus enhanced features:

### ✅ Starter Code Functions Implemented

The application includes **exact implementations** of all functions from the original starter code:

```python
def calculate_total_income(salary, side_hustle=0):
    """Calculate total monthly income - IMPLEMENTED ✅"""
    
def calculate_fixed_expenses(rent, insurance, phone, internet):
    """Add up monthly fixed costs - IMPLEMENTED ✅"""
    
def calculate_savings_potential(income, fixed_expenses, variable_expenses):
    """Determine how much can be saved - IMPLEMENTED ✅"""
    
def generate_budget_report(name, income, expenses, savings):
    """Create a formatted budget summary - IMPLEMENTED ✅"""
```

### 🌟 Enhanced Features
- 💰 Multiple income source tracking (salary + side hustle)
- 🏠 Fixed vs. variable expense categorization  
- 📊 Advanced expense categorization
- 🎯 Personalized savings goal calculation
- 📈 Professional budget report generation
- 🔍 Financial health insights and recommendations

### Core Features
- 💰 Monthly income tracking
- 📊 Expense categorization
- 🎯 Savings goal calculation
- 📈 Budget analysis and recommendations
- 🔍 Financial health insights

### Python Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Type Hints & Documentation**
   ```python
   def validate_amount(self, amount: str) -> Decimal:
       """Validate and convert string input to Decimal."""
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
   ```python
   try:
       decimal_amount = Decimal(amount)
   except InvalidOperation as e:
       raise ValueError(f"Invalid amount format: {amount}") from e
   ```

3. **Data Classes & Enums**
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class FinancialData:
       monthly_income: Decimal
       expenses: Dict[ExpenseCategory, Decimal]
   ```

4. **Logging & Monitoring**
   ```python
   logger.info("Personal Finance Calculator initialized")
   ```

5. **Decimal Precision for Financial Calculations**
   ```python
   from decimal import Decimal  # Avoids floating-point errors
   ```

- **`test_calculator.py`**: Validates that all functions work correctly

## �🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Basic understanding of Python syntax

### Quick Start

1. **Clone or download the files**
   ```bash
   cd week01day01
   ```

2. **Run the starter code demo (recommended first)**
   ```bash
   python starter_code_implementation.py
   ```

3. **Run the enhanced calculator**
   ```bash
   python personal_finance_calculator.py
   ```

4. **Run the comprehensive demo**
   ```bash
   python demo.py
   ```

5. **Run tests to see how validation works**
   ```bash
   python test_calculator.py
   ```

### Development Setup (Optional)

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with type checking
mypy personal_finance_calculator.py

# Format code
black personal_finance_calculator.py

# Lint code
flake8 personal_finance_calculator.py
```

## 📖 Usage Example

```text
=== Personal Finance Calculator ===
Let's analyze your monthly budget and savings potential!

Enter your monthly income ($): $5000

Now, let's collect your monthly expenses by category:
Enter monthly housing expenses ($): $1500
Enter monthly food expenses ($): $600
Enter monthly transportation expenses ($): $400
Enter monthly utilities expenses ($): $200
Enter monthly entertainment expenses ($): $300
Enter monthly healthcare expenses ($): $150
Enter monthly other expenses ($): $100

What percentage of income would you like to save? (default 20%): 25
